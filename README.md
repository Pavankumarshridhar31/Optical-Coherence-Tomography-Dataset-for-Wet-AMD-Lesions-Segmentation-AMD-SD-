The AMD-SD dataset comprises Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images specifically designed for segmenting lesions associated with wet Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Wet AMD is a significant cause of vision loss, making early detection and treatment crucial.

In this project, we utilized a segmentation model based on the U-Net architecture to predict and label the lesions in these OCT images. U-Net is well-known for its effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation tasks, leveraging an encoder-decoder structure that captures context while preserving spatial information. This allows for precise delineation of lesions, thereby aiding in the diagnosis and monitoring of wet AMD
